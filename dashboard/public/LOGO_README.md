# Logo Placement Instructions

## Logo File Location
Place your VigyanShaala logo file in this directory (`dashboard/public/`) with one of these names:
- `logo.png` (recommended)
- `logo.svg` (if using SVG format)
- `logo.jpg` (if using JPG format)

## Logo Specifications
- **Recommended size**: 200-300px width, auto height (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or SVG
- **Max height**: 50px (will be automatically scaled)

## Current Implementation
The logo is displayed in the top-left of the header, next to the "VigyanShaala MDM Dashboard" title.

If the logo file is not found, the image will not display but the page will still work.

## To Update Logo
1. Add your logo file to `dashboard/public/logo.png`
2. The logo will automatically appear in the header
3. No code changes needed - just replace the file
